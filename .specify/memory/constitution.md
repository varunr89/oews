# OEWS Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence
All code MUST follow consistent style and formatting standards enforced through automated tools (black, flake8). Code MUST be self-documenting with clear variable names and logical structure. Complex functions MUST include docstrings explaining purpose, parameters, and return values. Code reviews MUST verify readability, maintainability, and adherence to project patterns before merge approval.

### II. Testing Standards
Test-driven development MUST be followed: tests written before implementation, ensuring red-green-refactor cycles. Every feature MUST have comprehensive unit tests with >90% code coverage. Integration tests MUST validate database operations and API endpoints. Performance tests MUST verify response time requirements (<2 seconds for user interactions). All tests MUST pass before deployment to any environment.

### III. User Experience Consistency
User interface components MUST provide consistent visual design and interaction patterns across all features. Loading states MUST be clearly indicated for operations >500ms. Error messages MUST be user-friendly with actionable guidance. Filter interactions MUST preserve user context and provide immediate visual feedback. Data visualizations MUST follow accessibility standards with proper color contrast and alt text.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Database queries MUST execute in <1 second for typical user operations. Application startup MUST complete in <5 seconds. Memory usage MUST remain under allocated limits (1.75GB production). Caching strategies MUST be implemented for expensive computations and frequently accessed data. Performance monitoring MUST track and alert on degradation beyond acceptable thresholds.

### V. Data Integrity
Data accuracy MUST be validated against source BLS data through automated verification. Database schema MUST enforce referential integrity with foreign key constraints. Data loading operations MUST include transaction rollback on validation failures. All data modifications MUST be logged with timestamp and source tracking. Export functionality MUST preserve data precision and include source attribution.

## Technical Standards

Development environment MUST use Python 3.10+ with specified dependency versions in requirements.txt. Database operations MUST utilize SQLAlchemy ORM with proper connection pooling. Version control MUST follow conventional commit messages and semantic versioning. Security scanning MUST be performed on all dependencies before production deployment.

Code organization MUST follow the established project structure with clear separation of database, visualization, and utility modules. Configuration MUST be externalized through environment variables with secure credential management.

## Development Workflow

All feature development MUST begin with specification documentation and test planning. Code changes MUST pass automated testing, linting, and security checks before review. Pull requests MUST include test coverage reports and performance impact assessment. Deployment MUST follow blue-green strategies with automated health checks and rollback capabilities.

Database migrations MUST be versioned and tested in staging environments before production application. Performance benchmarks MUST be established and monitored to prevent regression.

## Governance

This constitution serves as the authoritative guide for all technical decisions and implementation choices. Principle violations MUST be justified through formal documentation and stakeholder approval. All architectural decisions MUST demonstrate alignment with core principles through documented analysis.

Amendment procedures require impact assessment, backward compatibility review, and migration planning. Compliance reviews MUST be conducted quarterly to ensure continued adherence. Development tooling MUST enforce these principles through automated validation where possible.

Technical debt MUST be tracked and prioritized against principle compliance. Performance requirements MUST be validated through regular load testing and user experience monitoring.
