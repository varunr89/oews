# Feature Specification: OEWS Excel to SQL Database Migration Application

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a application that migrates OEWS xls file into a SQL database. the script must go through all the excel files, get all the data container within them, create a common schema, and migrate the data over to sql database. finally it must run some data consistensy checks against the sql database."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identify: migration system, Excel files (OEWS data), SQL database, schema creation, data consistency validation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: data administrators, system operators
   ‚Üí Actions: read Excel files, create database schema, migrate data, validate consistency
   ‚Üí Data: OEWS Excel files with employment/wage statistics
   ‚Üí Constraints: data integrity, schema consistency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: bulk migration with validation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on migration capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí OEWS data structures, database schema, validation reports
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Ensure business focus, avoid implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: How should the system handle invalid or corrupted data during migration? ‚Üí A: Skip invalid records and continue processing
- Q: How should the system handle duplicate records found across multiple Excel files? ‚Üí A: Skip duplicate records after first occurrence
- Q: What should be the scope of the rollback capability when migration issues occur? ‚Üí A: Per-file rollback capability
- Q: How should the system handle updates to existing data during incremental migrations? ‚Üí A: Overwrite existing records with new data
- Q: What are the expected data volume limits for the migration system? ‚Üí A: 10 years of data. ~70mb per year

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A data administrator needs to consolidate historical OEWS (Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics) data stored across multiple Excel files into a centralized SQL database. The system must automatically discover all Excel files, analyze their structure, create a unified database schema, migrate all data while preserving relationships, and validate the migration was successful without data loss or corruption.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a directory containing multiple OEWS Excel files with varying structures, **When** the migration process is initiated, **Then** all files are discovered and their schemas are analyzed successfully
2. **Given** analyzed Excel file schemas, **When** the system creates a unified database schema, **Then** all data fields from all files can be accommodated without loss
3. **Given** a unified database schema, **When** data migration occurs, **Then** all records from all Excel files are transferred to the database with proper data type conversion
4. **Given** completed data migration, **When** consistency checks are executed, **Then** data integrity validation reports are generated showing any discrepancies or confirming successful migration
5. **Given** the migration process encounters corrupted or invalid Excel files, **When** processing continues, **Then** errors are logged and valid files continue to be processed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Excel files have different column names for the same data type?
- How does the system handle missing or null values during migration?
- What occurs when database constraints conflict with Excel data?
- How are duplicate records across multiple files identified and handled?
- What happens when Excel files are locked or corrupted?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST discover and enumerate all Excel files (.xls, .xlsx) in specified directory locations
- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze the structure and schema of each Excel file to identify data columns, types, and relationships
- **FR-003**: System MUST create a unified database schema that accommodates all data fields found across all Excel files by dynamically generating table and column definitions based on analyzed Excel structures (schema design phase)
- **FR-004**: System MUST migrate all data records from Excel files to the SQL database while preserving data integrity through transactional operations and validation (data migration execution phase)
- **FR-005**: System MUST perform data type conversion between Excel formats and SQL database types
- **FR-006**: System MUST skip invalid or corrupted data records during migration and continue processing valid records
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate migration reports showing successful record counts, failed records, and any data transformation applied
- **FR-008**: System MUST execute data validation comparing source Excel data with migrated database data including: record count validation, data type consistency verification, null value pattern matching, numeric precision validation, and string value integrity checks
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate referential integrity and data relationships after migration
- **FR-010**: System MUST identify and report any data discrepancies between source and target
- **FR-011**: System MUST skip duplicate records after the first occurrence during migration (as clarified in Session 2025-10-02)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide per-file rollback capability to undo migration of individual Excel files. Rollback can be triggered manually by user command or automatically on validation failures. Upon rollback, all records from the specified file are deleted from the database and marked as rolled back in audit logs
- **FR-013**: System MUST log all migration activities for audit and troubleshooting purposes
- **FR-014**: System MUST support incremental migrations for new Excel files and overwrite existing records with updated data from newer files. Records are matched using composite primary key derived from OEWS data structure (area, occupation, year)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST handle up to 10 years of OEWS data (approximately 700MB total volume) and complete full migration within 10 minutes
- **NFR-002**: System MUST process annual data files averaging 70MB each with minimum throughput of 10MB per minute
- **NFR-003**: System MUST support both SQLite (development/testing) and PostgreSQL (production) database backends

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **OEWS Excel Files**: Source data files containing occupational employment and wage statistics with varying schemas and structures. Real OEWS data files (2011-2024, ~70MB each) available in data/ directory for testing and validation
- **Unified Database Schema**: Target database structure designed to accommodate all data fields from source Excel files. Schema uses normalized relational design with separate tables for occupational data, wage statistics, and geographic areas, linked via foreign key relationships. Primary keys derived from OEWS data structure (area, occupation, year composite key)
- **Migration Records**: Tracking information for each migrated record including source file, transformation applied (data type conversion, null value normalization, special character handling for '#' and '*' suppression codes), and validation status
- **Validation Reports**: Reports documenting data integrity checks, discrepancies found, and migration success metrics
- **Error Logs**: Detailed records of any issues encountered during migration including file access problems, data validation failures, and constraint violations
