- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-12
- Q: How should users authenticate with Azure for the deployment? ‚Üí A: Azure CLI credentials (use existing `az login` session)
- Q: How thorough should the data consistency validation be after migration? ‚Üí A: Row counts + sample validation (random 10% of rows checked)
- Q: If the deployment fails partway through, what should happen to the partially created Azure resources? ‚Üí A: Automatic rollback (delete all created resources, restore to initial state)
- Q: How should the Azure SQL database name be determined? ‚Üí A: Auto-generated from local DB filename (e.g., oews.db ‚Üí oews-azure)
- Q: How should the Azure region for database deployment be specified? ‚Üí A: Configuration file (.env or config.json)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A data administrator has successfully migrated OEWS data to a local SQLite database and now needs to make this data accessible to cloud-based applications and services. They want to deploy the local database to Azure SQL Serverless to enable broader access while ensuring that all data is transferred correctly and completely.

The user configures the target Azure region in a configuration file, authenticates via Azure CLI (`az login`), and provides the path to their local database file. The system automatically generates the cloud database name from the local filename, handles the deployment process, and validates that the cloud database matches the local database exactly.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a valid local SQLite database file exists and valid Azure subscription credentials are provided, **When** the user initiates the deployment, **Then** the system creates an Azure SQL Serverless database and successfully migrates all data from the local database to the cloud database.

2. **Given** the data migration to Azure SQL has completed, **When** the system performs consistency validation, **Then** the system confirms that all tables, row counts, and data integrity checks match between local and cloud databases.

3. **Given** the user provides an invalid database file path, **When** the user attempts deployment, **Then** the system displays a clear error message indicating the file cannot be found or is not a valid database.

4. **Given** the user does not have an active Azure CLI session (not logged in via `az login`), **When** deployment is attempted, **Then** the system displays an error instructing the user to run `az login` first and stops the deployment process.

5. **Given** the configuration file is missing the Azure region setting or contains an invalid region, **When** deployment is attempted, **Then** the system displays a clear error message identifying the configuration issue and stops the deployment process.

6. **Given** a deployment is in progress, **When** the user monitors the process, **Then** the system displays progress updates for each major step (authentication, database creation, schema migration, data transfer, validation).

7. **Given** data consistency validation fails after migration, **When** the validation completes, **Then** the system reports specific inconsistencies found (e.g., missing tables, row count mismatches, data discrepancies) and provides remediation guidance.

8. **Given** a deployment fails during database creation or data migration, **When** the failure is detected, **Then** the system automatically initiates rollback, deletes all partially created Azure resources, and notifies the user of the cleanup completion.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the local SQLite database is very large (multiple GB)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: size limits or performance expectations?]
- How does the system handle network interruptions during data transfer?
- What happens if an Azure SQL database with the auto-generated name already exists in the subscription (naming collision)?
- How does the system handle schema differences between SQLite and Azure SQL (e.g., SQLite-specific data types)?
- What happens if the Azure subscription has insufficient quota or permissions to create resources?
- How does the system handle concurrent deployments or multiple database deployments?
- What happens if automatic rollback fails (e.g., network interruption during cleanup)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a file path to a local SQLite database file as input
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that the provided database file exists and is a valid SQLite database
