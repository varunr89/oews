# Feature Specification: Economic Analysis Agent for Regional Wage and Occupation Intelligence

**Feature Branch**: `001-interactive-data-filtering`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an agent that lets a curious user understand the economy of a U.S. region through occupations and wages, and compare it to other regions"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Curious professionals (analysts, founders, policymakers, job seekers) need to understand regional economic patterns through natural language questions about occupations and wages. Users start with plain-English questions like "How do nurse wages in Bellingham compare to Seattle?" and receive polished analytical briefs with charts, tables, and clear takeaways that guide decision-making.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user enters "How do nurse wages in Bellingham compare to Seattle?", **When** the agent processes the query, **Then** it displays a plan preview and generates a report with wage comparison charts and executive summary
2. **Given** a generated report is displayed, **When** a user clicks "Change timeframe" or "Add comparison area", **Then** the relevant sections regenerate while preserving other context
3. **Given** a completed analysis, **When** a user clicks "Export report as PDF", **Then** the system provides a formatted document with consistent labeling and source citations
4. **Given** the first-run experience, **When** a new user visits, **Then** they see example questions for Bellingham, WA and can click to execute them

### Edge Cases
- What happens when wage data is suppressed for an occupation in a small area?
- How does the system handle ambiguous occupation names (e.g., "nurse" vs specific RN classifications)?
- What occurs when users request analysis across too many areas or occupations simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Query Processing**
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept natural language questions about wages and occupations
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect entities (geography, occupations, timeframe, comparison areas, metrics) from user input
- **FR-003**: System MUST ask exactly one follow-up question when essential information is missing
- **FR-004**: System MUST display a human-readable plan preview before execution
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to edit detected entities inline using interactive chips

**First-Run Experience**
- **FR-006**: System MUST present a 2-step intro asking for location and interest area
- **FR-007**: System MUST offer 4 clickable example questions defaulting to Bellingham, WA
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide example questions covering wage comparisons, growth analysis, top occupations, and cross-regional comparisons

**Report Generation**
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate reports with title, executive summary, key charts, tables, method notes, sources, and suggested next questions
- **FR-010**: System MUST create executive summaries with 5-8 bullet points containing specific numbers and directional comparisons
- **FR-011**: System MUST select minimal chart sets that directly answer the user's question
- **FR-012**: System MUST include sortable, paginated tables with relevant data
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide method notes explaining comparisons, definitions, and data caveats

**Refinement and Interaction**
- **FR-014**: Users MUST be able to change timeframes, add/remove comparison areas, and filter by occupation groups through inline actions
- **FR-015**: System MUST regenerate only impacted sections when users make refinements
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain prior context and choices visible during refinements
- **FR-017**: System MUST remember last used geography, timeframe, and top 5 queried occupations within session

**Export and Accessibility**
- **FR-018**: Users MUST be able to export reports as PDF and download data as CSV
- **FR-019**: System MUST ensure exported charts include readable titles, axes, units, and footnotes
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide tooltips that define metrics (e.g., "P50 = median hourly wage")
- **FR-021**: System MUST use explicit legends and avoid color-only encoding for accessibility

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Time to first useful summary MUST be ‚â§ 10 seconds
- **PR-002**: Users MUST be able to refine to satisfactory answer within ‚â§ 3 interactions
- **PR-003**: System MUST display progress feedback with specific step descriptions during processing
- **PR-004**: Export fidelity MUST match on-screen content with 100% accuracy

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Natural Language Query**: User input containing geographic areas, occupations, timeframes, and analytical intent
- **Entity Detection Result**: Parsed components including detected geography, occupation codes, comparison areas, years, and metrics
- **Analysis Plan**: Human-readable preview showing data retrieval, filtering, comparison, and visualization steps
- **Economic Report**: Structured output containing title, executive summary, charts, tables, method notes, sources, and next questions
- **Refinement Action**: User-initiated modifications to timeframe, geography, occupations, or analysis scope
- **Session Context**: Remembered user preferences including last geography, timeframe, and queried occupations
